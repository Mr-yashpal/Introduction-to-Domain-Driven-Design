# what is domain driven design

In the past there is a very smart person called Eric Evans which basically wrote a book called domain driven design in 2003 and what he did is that he took all the best practices of developing his software and created a book around it and coined some new terms which are very common these days. In today's architecture domain driven design is well respected in architects community so what is it. Eric Evans says
> we are developing a software our focus shouldn't be primarily on technology it should be primarily on business or whatever activity we are trying to assist with the software the domain domain is the business that we are trying to solve or trying to assist with that software now this domain can be any business to mean for example it can be aviation domain it can be railways it can be banking it can be insurance it can be ecommerce or any any sort of domain I think you get the idea and second line that he says is that.
> specifically we prose that by trying to develop models of that domain and make our software conform to that.

You can understand it as DDD is a way of looking at software from top to down.
so at the bottom when you write the code and everything is done when you deploy it to production you either have exe jar or zip depending on whether you have node
